# CS260 Project - University Rankings
For this project, our group mainly explored how private and public schools performed to aid in the decision making for college applicants.

We asked the following questions in order to discover relationships between variables:

Do private schools have a higher in-state tuition than public schools?
Does the numerical rank of the university increase as the acceptance rate increases for public and/or private school?
Is there a relationship between the school's type (public/private) and the freshman retention rate? (i.e. do public or private schools tend to have higher freshman retention rates?) We used rank to explore this relationship as well.
Is there a relationship between the school's type and its 6 year graduation rate? (i.e. do public / private schools tend to have higher / lower 6 year graduation rates?) We used rank to explore this relationship as well.
Does school rank and 6 year graduation rate have a negative correlation, and do we see the same results for public / private schools?

Each of these questions allowed us to determine a difference/similarity between public and private universities.
In summary, our results showed that in general, private schools perform better than public schools in terms of rank, freshman retention rate, and 6 year graduation rate, but at the cost of being significantly more expensive.
